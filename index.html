                <p style = "font-size:1.5rem">I interviewed 3 users, all of whom were graduate students at Brown about the coffee machine in CIT on the 4th floor.
                    All three users drank coffee on a daily basis and had made coffee using their own tools.

                    <ul>
                        <li>Have you used this coffee machine before?</li>
                        <li>What do you use to make your coffee (e.g., french press, espresso machine)?</li>
                        <li>What are some pros and cons of making coffee with this machine as opposed to using other methods you`ve used to make your coffee?</li>
                        <li>What are some things you like and dislike about the UI design of this coffee machine?</li>
                        <li>What are some satisfactory and unsatisfactory qualities of the coffee made from this machine?</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>All three users use non-automatic ways to make coffee such as french press and instant coffee powder when they are not in CIT. They liked that the machine made coffee more quickly than the methods they used.</li>
                        <li>Two out of the three interviewed users had never used the coffee machine before. The new users said they could not initially figure out that the machine made coffee with pods that were stored in shelves above the machine. They also said they had trouble figuring out how to open the pod compartment.</li>
                        <li>The two new users pushed the pod compartment with their hand to close it despite the warning message under the compartment not to do so.</li>
                        <li>Two out of the three users said the coffee that the machine made was too acidic or smelled unpleasant.</li>
                        <li>All three users pointed out that the “Open” button for opening the pod compartment should stand out more from other buttons and clearly indicate whether it opens the pod compartment or the compostable bin.</li>
